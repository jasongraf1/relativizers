# Analyzing English restrictive relativizers

Documentation and R code for multinomial analysis of English restrictive relativizers, as reported in Grafmiller, Szmrecsanyi & Hinrichs (forthcoming). 

## Organization of repository

This repository contains all the necessary files for reproducing the analysis, including the dataset and R code, along with some additional documentation. The files are organized into the following subdirectories:
- **R**
- **data**
- **documents**

In addition, an [.Rprofile](.Rprofile) script is included which loads all the necessary packages along with all the "Extensions.R" files. This should be sourced at the outset, before running other files.

```
source('.Rprofile')
```

#### *R* 

This subdirectory contains R scripts for setting up the dataframe, running the factor analysis of mixed data, and running the Bayesian regression models using the [MCMCglmm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCglmm/index.html) package. It also contains a number of supplementary files containing various custom functions. 
- [data_setup.R](R/data_setup.R): code for loading and readying the dataset
- [FAMD_analysis.R](R/FAMD_analysis.R): code for running factor analysis of mixed data
- [MCMCglmm_models.R](R/MCMCglmm_models.R): code for fitting the MCMCglmm models, obtaining the model predictions, and plotting and displaying the model results. 
- [MCMCglmmExtensions.R](R/MCMCglmmExtensions.R): functions for working with MCMCglmm objects, e.g. calculating VIF and &kappa; scores
- [merExtensions.R](R/merExtensions.R): functions for working with mixed-effects regression model objects created with lme4. 
- [ggExtensions.R](R/ggExtensions.R): functions for simplifying plots in [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) 
- [statsExtensions.R](R/statsExtensions.R): functions for various statistical procedures, e.g. calculating standard errors, effect size measures (Cohen's *d*, Cramer's *V*), and scaling variables
- [generalExtensions.R](R/generalExtensions.R): miscellaneous functions for, e.g. manipulating objects, creating pop-up notifications, loading/detaching multiple items simultaneously.

#### data

This subdirectory contains the tab-delimited file [relative_clauses.txt](data/relative_clauses.txt). This is a modified version of the dataset collected and annotated by Hinrichs, Szmrecsanyi & Bohmann ([2015](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/language/v091/91.4.hinrichs.html)). 

#### documents

This subdirectory contains two files documenting the dataset [CodeBookDec2011.pdf](documents/CodeBookDec2011.pdf) and two files from the MCMCglmm package documentation.
